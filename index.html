 			<h1>Our Story</h1>
 			<div class="OurStory"><h3>Starting with our flagship Luxe Lager, the portfolio of Luxe Brewery has grown to a wide-ranging collection of beers, always keeping an eye to traditional brewing techniques, even as Brewmaster Melissa McLaughlin and her team seek to push the boundaries of beer. Itâ€™s now easy to find a smooth Luxe Lager, hoppy Lost & Found IPA or Sweet & Salty Stout in your favorite watering holes. Each season brings beloved seasonals like our new Slope Strangers Ale!
			Founded in 2014, Luxe Brewery has been a pioneer in craft brewing. After visiting countless breweries and beer festivals around the country, Melissa noticed that many of them were lacking personality and creativity. Luxe aims to standout from the competition and inspire its drinker!</h3> </div>

 			<h1>Beers</h1>
 				<div class="BeerColOne">
 					<h2>Slope Strangers Ale</h2> 
 						<h3>Light, medium-bodied golden ale with bready aroma and malt forward flavor. Luxe ale is brewed with two strains of Trappist yeast, one Belgian ale yeast and Belgian candi sugar. Fruity and spicy, it's smooth, drinkable and perfectly balanced.
 						</h3>
 				</div>
   				<div class="BeerColTwo">
   					<h2>Luxe Lager</h2>
   						<h3>Luxe Lager is amber-gold in color and displays a firm malt center supported by a refreshing bitterness and floral hop aroma. Caramel malts show in the finish. We use six different grains to perfect a balanced flavor of malt and hops, and a special proprietary lager yeast to give Luxe Lager an exceptional, long-lasting smooth finish that's meant to be enjoyed all year long.
   						</h3>
   				</div>
  				<div class="BeerColThree">
  					<h2>Lost & Found IPA</h2> 
  						<h3>American IPA brewed with pale, red and caramel malts. This copper-colored ale is liberally hopped and dry hopped with Willamette and Columbus hops. The intense hop character adds more spice to the meal and makes it a perfect choice to team up with many spicy dishes.
  						</h3>
